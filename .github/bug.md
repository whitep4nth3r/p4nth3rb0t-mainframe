This project was created not to be 'production ready' at Enterprise standard, but instead be a fun and interactive project that can also be used to learn together on stream. 

Genuine bugs may happen and these are appreciated, but your opinion of how the code could be written differently or 'better' is not a bug.

Before submitting a bug request, please follow the questions in this chart:
